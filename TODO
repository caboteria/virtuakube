CLI tool instead of standalone examples
Close doesn't sequence shutdown properly any more, leaves dangling VMs and switches
adjust RTC settings for vms
MetalLB tests!
Freezing a VM if you never started it will result in a broken VM on thaw. Unusual case but I should fix it someday.
Stop storing contexts in structs, that's naughy and defeats static analysis tools

New API:
 - vkube Open() and Create(), similar to os.File. Either create an
   empty universe, or open an existing one.
   - Does Opening an existing universe immediately resume everything
     inside it? I think so?
 - universe.Close() stops everything, reverts everything to savepoint.
 - universe.Save() stops everything, but snapshots everything so the
   next Open() will resume from this moment.
 - universe.Destroy() stops everything, deletes everything. Nuke the
   universe.
 - Images are a component of universes. Read-only images that serve as
   bases for several VMs.
 - VM references an Image as its base.
 - VMs run in -snapshot mode, so Close() is a pkill + nothing. Save is
   a stop+savevm+commit_all+quit. Destroy is Close() + rm -rf.
 - There's no multiple snapshots. The way you persistently branch the
   universe is cp -R.
